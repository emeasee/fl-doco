Members are assigned a role within the Enterprise which dictates their access to various elements of the FieldLogs platform. Roles can even be even be given rules that contain extra conditional logic, giving very fine grain control over access to types of Templates, Jobs and more. By default every Enterprise comes with a set of roles already configured to cover a modern SWI workflow. Administrators may wish to edit these default roles by renaming or adding custom rules, or even adding new roles that suit better the enterprise workflow."
