  "intro": "Being able to collaborative create Templates is only one side of FieldLogs. The other is the ability to assign Templates to those in the field so that you can set a standard work practice for field data capture that can optionally be viewed in real-time by others in the Enterprise. The ability fully utilises the apps that we have built for modern mobile devices. A product manager, for example, can assign a newly approved template to their teams in the field, in less than a few minutes.",
