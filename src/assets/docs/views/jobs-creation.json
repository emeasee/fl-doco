The benefit of this is that all contextual information about a Job done is attached to the Job so a User can go back and view all key information such as which Template was used, when what the Job completed and a range of meta-data."

This mode helps to save on device battery power and is recommended for long Jobs where a clear GPS route may not be as important. 'Continuous' acquires GPS points automatically and continuously leading to a clear GPS 'track' on the map."
